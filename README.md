# game-engineering

This project was to design a mini-game with mulitple play modes, adversarial AI, collision detection and feedback and Newtonian Physics.

To access the project, download the .zip file and open it in Unity.
I have brough out the code files but they can be found in the .zip file in "Scripts" in "Assets".
